    "# **Case Study: Yelp Restaurant Recommendation System Part 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "## **Context**\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "**Yelp** was founded in **2004** to help people find **great local businesses**. Today, the website and their mobile application publish crowd-sourced reviews about local businesses as well as certain metadata about them that can help in customer's **decision-making process**. Yelp uses automated software to recommend the **most helpful** and **reliable reviews** for the Yelp community from such a large and diverse dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Yelp dataset is a large collection of user reviews, business metadata, business check-ins, users' social network data, user tips for businesses across 10 cities spread across **4 countries**. The original dataset is very huge with ~ 11GB of data. In this case study, we will only use a subset of data due to hardware limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "## **Objective**\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case study, we will build three types of recommendation systems: \n",
    "- **Clustering-based recommendation system**\n",
    "- **Content-based collaborative filtering**\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "## **Dataset**\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We will only use the following four attributes from the **yelp_reviews dataset**: \n",
    "- business_id\n",
    "- business_name\n",
    "- stars\n",
    "- user_id\n",
    "- text: The text review by the user"

I'm pretty sure they only use ingredients from their garden and blend them fresh when you order it.  It was amazing.\\n\\nWhile EVERYTHING on the menu looks excellent, I had the white truffle scrambled eggs vegetable skillet and it was tasty and delicious.

While waiting to turn onto 16th Street the \"Grand Opening\" sign caught my eye and my little yelping soul leaped for joy!  A new place to try!\\n\\nIt looked desolate from the outside but when I opened the door I was put at easy by the decor, smell and cleanliness inside.  I ordered dinner for two, to go.  The menu was awesome.  I loved seeing all the variety: poblano peppers, mole, mahi mahi, mushrooms...something wrapped in banana leaves.  It made it difficult to choose something.  Here's what I've had so far: La Condesa Shrimp Burro and Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco.  They are both were very delicious meals but the shrimp burro stole the show.  So much flavor.  I snagged some bites from my hubbys mole and mahi mahi burros- mmmm such a delight.  The salsa bar is endless.  I really stocked up.  I was excited to try the strawberry salsa but it was too hot, in fact it all was, but I'm a big wimp when it comes to hot peppers. The horchata is handmade and delicious.  They throw pecans and some fruit in there too which is a yummy bonus!\\n\\nAs if the good food wasn't enough to win me over the art in this restaurant sho did!  I'm a sucker for Mexican folk art and Frida Kahlo is my Oprah.  There's a painting of her and Diego hanging over the salsa bar, it's amazing.  All the paintings are great, love the artist.</td>\n",
